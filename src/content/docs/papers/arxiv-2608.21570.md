## 摘要原文

Deploying a safety layer for large language models on commodity hardware is constrained by the guards available to do it: current open guard models hold between 1 and 9 billion parameters, are oriented toward the graphics processing unit, and answer in seconds per request on a central processing unit. This paper presents a reproducible, license-aware knowledge-distillation recipe addressing that constraint. A strong open guard labels a corpus of roughly 97,000 prompts, drawn from 24 public datasets, into seven safety categories aligned to a public hazard taxonomy, and a fleet of small students spanning lexical, shallow, encoder and generative architectures is trained to reproduce that signal. The corpus is partitioned at the license boundary, so that a deployable and a research model differ only in their training data and the cost of that restriction becomes measurable. Every model is scored against an independent gold benchmark of 6,361 rows over four slices, labeled apart from the teacher and including a slice of harmless prompts that makes over-defense measurable. The distilled students match the teachers on adversarial text within overlapping confidence intervals and reduce false alarms on harmless prompts, the smallest generative student reaching 3.8% against 4.8% for the 8-billion-parameter teacher, while the encoder classifies in roughly 24 ms per request on CPU. Per-class rebalancing is the only decisive ingredient of the recipe. No superiority over the distilled guards is claimed; on the clean reference slice they remain ahead.
