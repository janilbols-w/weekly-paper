## 摘要原文

Structured data exists in many forms (tables, knowledge graphs, charts, and time series), and converting it into text may involve different generation tasks. However, most prior work on data-to-text (D2T) generation has focused on specific tasks and datasets, relying either on task-specific training data or on the zero-shot capabilities of large language models. We study cross-domain D2T generation in a setting where neither in-domain training text nor test references are available, and where domains, generation goals, and input structures vary substantially. We compare data-driven knowledge distillation (DDKD) against zero-shot inference and fine-tuning on out-of-domain D2T data, and introduce structure-preserving augmentation via structural subsampling and perturbation. Experiments on five benchmarks show that, at constant model size (1.7B parameters), DDKD consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and zero-shot inference. Moreover, the resulting small models outperform a much larger finetuned model on two of the five domains, achieving comparable performance on the remaining three. We further construct QUINTD-5, a fivefold extension of QUINTD-1, and show that simply scaling real target-domain inputs yields only modest gains, whereas our augmentation strategy remains more effective and more cost-efficient for cross-domain distillation.
